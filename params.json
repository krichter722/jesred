I tested with\r\n    the extract of the first 100.000 entries from our parent cache's\r\n    access.log file and our class B subnet - i.e. 141.44.0.0/16 )\r\n\r\nMain drawback wrt. squirm 1.0 betaB:\r\n=====================================\r\n - it uses about 256 KB more than squirm on solaris 2.6\r\n   (but anyway, it is still less than perl 5.004 ;-))\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
