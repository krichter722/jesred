JESRED INSTALLATION:

COMMON: For best performance on Solaris 2.x I recommend to compile everything
        with __Sun's C compiler >= 4.0__  or  GNU c compiler >= 2.8.0 and a
        optimization level >= 4 . At least on Solaris >= 2.5 you should use
        the regex functions from the OS' std libc instead of GNU regex-0.12!!!

0) if you do NOT want to use the regex functions of your OS standard libraries,
   get GNU regex-0.12 or higher and compile it as described in its INSTALL
   file (we only need regex.h and regex.o, so u do not need to install it!)
   WARNING: Per default it compiles with debug option and no optimization.
   So edit its Makefile, to get better code (i.e. more performance).

   GNU regex is available via:
   ftp://ftp.tu-chemnitz.de/pub/gnu/regex-0.12.tar.gz    (GNU mirror) or
   ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/regex-0.12.tar.gz


1) edit the Makefile and insert the appropriate values for:
   - your compiler ( CC )
   - compiler options like optimization level etc. ( AC_FLAGS )
   - extra libraries like -lnsl or -lxnet etc. ( XTRA_LIBS )
   - enable debug option, if you want enable/disable debugging during
     jesred runs ( DEBUG )
   - if you use GNU regex, uncomment XOBJS and DEFS and sustitute
     regex-0.12 with the path, where your GNU regex.[ho] resides
   - if you want to use redirect rules with ACCEL option, add
     -DUSE_ACCEL to DEFS.

2) edit path.h and set the DEFAULT_PATH to the directory, where jesred
   will find its configuration file jesred.conf

3) make

4) copy jesred to an appropriate directory

5) create the jesred configuration file DEFAULT_PATH/jesred.conf
   (an example with explanations is located in ./etc) and the rewrite.allow
   and rewrite.rule file or whichever file names you set in jesred.conf
   If you forget it and start/reconfigure squid, jesred prints out a
   warning messages to stderr an continues to work in echo_mode.
   You can still copy the configuration file to the appropriate location
   and send a HUP signal to ALL redirector processes to read in the new one ;-)

   NOTE: in all configuration files, all leading and trailing white spaces
         of a line are ignored. 2nd, a line which starts with a '#' is
         ignored completely!

6) optional: Verify/Test of jesred
   a) create a redirect file (e.g. from your squid native access.log file with
      head -100000 access.log | awk -p '{ print $7 " " $3"/-" " " $8 " " $6}' \
	>/var/tmp/testurls
      )
   b) enable the log files in jesred.conf
   c) jesred < /var/tmp/testurls >/dev/null
   d) check out the log files (see jesred.conf)

7) modify in squid.conf the redirect_program tag (e.g.
   redirect_program /local/squid/bin/jesred )

8) check out, if redirect_children in squid_conf meets your needs

9) reconfigure squid (e.g. squid -k reconfigure)

10) check out the log files, if you have enabled them in jesred.conf
