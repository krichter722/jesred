------------------ Jesred is a Squid redirector program. -------------------

It is derived from Chris Foote's
and Wayne Piekarski's squirm 1.0 betaB (see http://www.senet.com.au/squirm/)
and uses some slightly modified routines (IP ACL stuff) from squid (see
http://squid.nlanr.net).

For more information about Squid redirectors see
http://squid.nlanr.net/Squid/FAQ/FAQ-14.html

Main improvements wrt. squirm 1.0 betaB:
=========================================
 - uses a configuration file (jesred.conf)
 - strict usage of subnet/mask notation and squid's ip acl lists to determine,
   whether to rewrite the passed URL for a specific client/sibling or not
   (probably a big plus for Class A and B networks)
 - optionally allows to rewrite URL's for siblings as well
 - optionally logging of common and error messages to a file
 - optionally logging of URL rewrites to a separate file
 - avoids persistent opening/closing of the log file[s]
 - supports reconfiguration via 'kill -HUP pid' and re-reads the complete
   configuration file, and that's why it is able to change the following
   on the fly, i.e. no need to restart squid:
    - change the used log file[s] (useful for log file rotation - just
      rewrite jesred.conf and send a HUP signal to jesred processes)
    - enable/disable logging
    - enable/disable debug mode if compiled with DEBUG option
    - enable/disable URL rewriting of ICP_QUERY (sibling) requests
            ******************************************
 - finally: * ABOUT TWICE AS FAST as squirm 1.0betaB *
            ******************************************
   (even with ICP_QUERY URL rewriting it was still twice as fast as squirm -
    remember: squirm allows to rewrite GET requests only! I tested with
    the extract of the first 100.000 entries from our parent cache's
    access.log file and our class B subnet - i.e. 141.44.0.0/16 )

Main drawback wrt. squirm 1.0 betaB:
=====================================
 - it uses about 256 KB more than squirm on solaris 2.6
   (but anyway, it is still less than perl 5.004 ;-))
